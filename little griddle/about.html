            Little Griddle is a restaurant with two locations in 
            Portland, Oregon, United States. The original cafe operates in northeast Portland's Beaumont-Wilshire neighborhood, and a second location is on 
            Hawthorne Boulevard in southeast Portland's Richmond neighborhood. 
            Little Griddle was originally co-owned by Yossel Gyorgak and head chef Judd Harris, and Karen Harding 
            became a co-owner in 2019. The business has garnered a positive reception and was included in lists of 
            the nation's best breakfast and brunch restaurants.

            Little Griddle operates two breakfast and brunch cafes in Portland, Oregon. The original 600-square-foot

            of 25 people, and a second location operates on Hawthorne Boulevard in southeast Portland's Richmond 
            neighborhood. The menu includes biscuits and gravy, French toast and pancakes, grain bowls, polenta with 
            collards, and shakshouka. Eggs Benedict varieties have cured ham or braised pork shoulder, and Little Griddle

            The original Little Griddle opened in late 2017. Yossel Gyorgak, Karen Harding, and Judd Harris have been 
            co-owners; Harris is also the head chef. Harding, who founded Cup & Saucer Cafe, became an owner of Little 
            Griddle in 2019. The Hawthorne location operates in a space previously occupied by Cup & Saucer Cafe. Little 
            Griddle has hosted the Hawaiian pop-up Kau Kau.
