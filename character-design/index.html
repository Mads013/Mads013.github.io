            <h2>Can Character Design be used Effectively for a Spice Brand?</h2>
            <a href="assets/pdf/final-prospectus.pdf" target="_blank">My Prospectus</a>
            
            <h3>Main Objective</h3>
            <p>
                For my spice brand project, I’m bringing a world to life through characters that not only teach cooking but also make it fun. I’m developing these characters, each linked to a different spice, and weaving them into a brand that can grow with its audience. The project will involve character profiles, sketches, drawings, packaging designs, and short storyboards to show how these spices interact. At the end of it all, I’m aiming to create a brand with a short cookbook that’ll serve both kids & adults, showcasing how the spices play off one another in the kitchen.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This article explores how Pixar's style stands out through its unique character modeling, focusing on the elements of design, color, and character flaws. The character proportions are broken down as well.</p>

            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Pixar's basic modeling elements mostly use round and smooth curves. The circle has a wide range of affinities and is a morphological element full of tension. The smooth curve design gives the audience more comfort." (pg 95)</li>
                <li>"The head-to-body ratio of Pixar's modeling is relatively small, and it emphasizes exaggeration." (pg 95)</li>
                <li>Pixar's Golden Ratio-<br>Pixar's figure shape uses a constant proportion value, which emphasizes coordination. (pg 96)</li>
                <li>"Pixar modeling uses more accessories and more emphasis on richness"</li>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical Significance: Pepper has played a pivotal role in global trade and economics, once used as currency and influencing explorations and conquests.</li>
            <li>Varieties of Peppercorns: The main types of peppercorns—black, white, green, and specialty types like cubeb and long pepper—all offer different flavors and uses, depending on how they are processed and where they are grown.</li>

        <p>
            Pepper has been a critical spice throughout history, valued for its flavor and even used as currency. The dried fruit of Piper nigrum produces various types of peppercorns, each offering distinct flavors based on maturity and processing. Tellicherry peppercorns, grown on India’s Malabar Coast, are considered the highest quality, offering bold, pungent flavors. Other notable varieties include green peppercorns for their bright zest and white peppercorns with a floral, delicate taste. Specialty peppers like cubeb, long pepper, and pink peppercorns have distinct flavors and historical significance. Pepper remains a cornerstone of global spice trade today.

        <h3>Shape Language Technique (What/Why/How)</h3>
        <a href="https://pixune.com/blog/shape-language-technique/#:~:text=Shape%20theory%20character%20design%20not,represent%20solidity%20in%20shape%20psychology." target="_blank">Link</a>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>A guide to different kinds of shapes and how they reflect the characters personalities.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
    <h3>Shape Types & Meanings:</h3>

    <h3>Circles:</h3>
    <p>Traits: Represent unity, wholeness, and freedom of movement.</p>
    <p>Personality: Often associated with friendly, approachable, and cheerful characters due to their softness and inclusion.</p>
    <p>Symbolism: Reflect harmony, infinity, and community. Circles are smooth and create a sense of freedom and calm. They lack edges, which makes them non-threatening and gentle.</p>
    
    <h3>Triangles:</h3>
    <p>Traits: Represent power, action, and conflict.</p>
    <p>Personality: Triangles convey danger, unpredictability, and strength. They are used to signify characters who are dynamic, energetic, or even antagonistic due to their sharp angles.</p>
    <p>Symbolism: Associated with tension, action, and conflict, triangles suggest instability and edginess. They often symbolize danger (like in warning signs) or strength due to their pointed shapes.</p>
    
    <h3>Squares:</h3>
    <p>Traits: Represent stability, structure, and reliability.</p>
    <p>Personality: Squares reflect characters who are steady, dependable, or even stubborn. They have a solid, grounded appearance, which adds depth and trustworthiness to designs.</p>
    <p>Symbolism: Squares suggest logic, order, and balance. They are often perceived as masculine shapes due to their straightforward, solid form and association with safety and containment.</p>
    
    <h3>Line Orientation:</h3>
    <p>Horizontal lines: Calm, peaceful, and grounded.</p>
    <p>Vertical lines: Active, powerful, and growing.</p>
    <p>Diagonal lines: Turbulent, dynamic, and restless.</p>
    
    <h3>Character Design:</h3>
    <p>Using shapes to define a character’s personality can make the design more memorable and engaging. For example:</p>
    <p>Characters with round shapes (like round faces or bodies) are typically perceived as friendly, cheerful, and non-threatening.</p>
    <p>Characters with angular or triangular shapes may be seen as more intense, dynamic, or dangerous, often reflecting antagonist traits.</p>
    <p>Square or rectangular characters often feel grounded, strong, and reliable, symbolizing characters who are stable but may also be perceived as stubborn.</p>

    <h3>The Character Designer</h3>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Helpful methods for designing characters</p>
</div>
<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Shape language is a powerful tool in character design that helps artists communicate a character's personality and purpose through the deliberate use of shapes. There are three primary shapes—squares, circles, and triangles—each with its own psychological and emotional associations.</p>

<h3>Primary Shapes & Their Meanings:</h3>

<h4>Circle:</h4>
<p>Traits: Peace, kindness, softness, safety, and femininity.</p>
<p>Personality: Characters designed with circular shapes are often perceived as kind, soft, and happy. Circles can evoke both positive and negative emotions, representing wholeness or, in some cases, loneliness or mystery. This shape is often associated with femininity but can be used to soften male characters as well.</p>

<h4>Square:</h4>
<p>Traits: Stability, strength, reliability, and masculinity.</p>
<p>Personality: Square-shaped characters exude physicality, dependability, and discipline. However, they can also come across as boring, rigid, or even unintelligent. This shape is strongly linked to masculine traits, but it can also make female characters feel strong and independent.</p>

<h4>Triangle:</h4>
<p>Traits: Movement, sharpness, danger, and deviation.</p>
<p>Personality: Triangles are neither inherently masculine nor feminine. They represent action, instability, and danger. Characters designed with severe angles (triangles) often feel sharp, unstable, and dangerous, making this shape commonly used for villains or edgy characters.</p>

<h3>Combining Shapes:</h3>
<p>Just like mixing primary colors can create a broader palette, combining primary shapes adds complexity to character designs. A purely square character may feel too simple, but mixing in other shapes can make the character feel more dynamic and nuanced.</p>

<h3>Shape Language Across Characters:</h3>
<p>In a character lineup, maintaining a consistent shape language (like having a "visual accent") is crucial for creating a unified world. If one character uses a drastically different shape language from others, it will stand out and feel out of place, similar to how a person with a different accent might draw attention in a foreign region.</p>
