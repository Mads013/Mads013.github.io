            <h2>Can Character Design be used Effectively for a Spice Brand?</h2>
            <a href="assets/pdf/final-prospectus.pdf" target="_blank">My Prospectus</a>
            
            <h3>Main Objective</h3>
            <p>
                For my spice brand project, I’m bringing a world to life through characters that not only teach cooking but also make it fun. I’m developing these characters, each linked to a different spice, and weaving them into a brand that can grow with its audience. The project will involve character profiles, sketches, drawings, packaging designs, and short storyboards to show how these spices interact. At the end of it all, I’m aiming to create a brand with a short cookbook that’ll serve both kids & adults, showcasing how the spices play off one another in the kitchen.

            <h3>Research on the Paradigm of Pixar Animation Modeling</h3>
            <a href="https://francis-press.com/uploads/papers/TLLXuYxwqUbXHDgT65v64UxBEdOs2VfXZFihzkcM.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>This article explores how Pixar's style stands out through its unique character modeling, focusing on the elements of design, color, and character flaws. The character proportions are broken down as well.</p>

            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Pixar's basic modeling elements mostly use round and smooth curves. The circle has a wide range of affinities and is a morphological element full of tension. The smooth curve design gives the audience more comfort." (pg 95)</li>
                <li>"The head-to-body ratio of Pixar's modeling is relatively small, and it emphasizes exaggeration." (pg 95)</li>
                <li>Pixar's Golden Ratio-<br>Pixar's figure shape uses a constant proportion value, which emphasizes coordination. (pg 96)</li>
                <li>"Pixar modeling uses more accessories and more emphasis on richness"</li>
            </ul>
